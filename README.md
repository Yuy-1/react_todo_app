!!Live demo link above!!

This is a CRUD react app deployed using Vite.
The user is able to create to do items, edit them afterwards, and delete them.
Clicking edit will bring up a hidden edit task field. 
Clicking elsewhere with the edit field up will close the edit field and not save the users submission. 
The app uses hooks to save items to local storage. Refreshing the page will show the users previously added tasks.
